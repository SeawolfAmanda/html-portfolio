    <p>Being a rom-com fantasy mix, this tale of a magic world beyond the wall is sure to catch your attention.</p>
    <p>Showcasing multiple "box-office" names, including Robert DeNiro, this adventure of romance, murder, and magic is sure to catch the attention of most.</p>

<h3>Practical Magic</h3>

    <p>It should be no secret Practical Magic is on this list, and coming in 2nd place at that.</p>
    <p>Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman deliver an outstanding performance on love, relationships, sisterhood, and a bit of Witchcraft.</p>
    <p>There's no way snuggling up with a fluffy blanket, hot cocoa, and Ms. Bullock and Ms. Kidman wouldn't bring peace and tranquility.</p>

<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>

    <p>If you are unfamiliar with this knockout film, based on true stories regarding NASA and a group of black women, I recommend you don't even wait for a "do nothing" weekend to get this one in the books.</p>
    <p>That's right, this movie is perfect for any occasion. Especially if you want to feel empowered, humbled, or enlightened, it covers all bases.</p>
    <p>Based on a true story from our very own NASA during the cold war, times of segregation and sexism, a group of African-American Women mathmeticians took a large part in the successes of NASA. </p>
