<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Me.jpg" height="200"/>
<p>Hello! My name is Amanda, I've recently decided to attempt to learn Web Developtment.  While there's a very good chance it's too much 
for me to take in, and apply in the real-world; I'm enjoying the journey thus far. My "background" has nothing to do with Web Development,
or even adjacent, however, I do know with my experience that creating resources for others to utilize is a passion of mine. 
</p>
<p>Previously, I've worked with Customer Service, the Mortgage Industry, and currently in Administration. I'm sure you can easily guess 
    why I've made the switch to learn coding. Then again, maybe not. How does CS or Admin lady switch from working with people to working
     with computers FOR people? Easily, all the people around me are somehow involved in the IT world, from my D&D Group, to my partner...
     and quite frankly, I'm too old to have to deal with customers anymore, I simply cannot do it, at least not in Customer Service.
